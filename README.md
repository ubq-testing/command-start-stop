# `@ubiquibot/command-start-stop` 

This plugin allows a hunter to begin a task as well as gracefully stop a task without incurring a negative impact on the hunter's XP or karma.

## Usage

### Start a task

To start a task, a hunter should use the `/start` command. This will assign them to the issue so long as the following is true:

- Price labels are set on the issue
- The issue is not already assigned
- The hunter has not reached the maximum number of concurrent tasks
- The command is not disabled at the repository or organization level
- TODO: If the hunter meets the required XP requirements

### Stop a task

To stop a task, a hunter should use the `/stop` command. This will unassign them from the issue so long as the following is true:

- The hunter is assigned to the issue
- The command is not disabled at the repository or organization level
- The command is called on the issue, not the associated pull request
